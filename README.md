# Predictive Modeling of Harmful Algal Blooms in the Western Basin of Lake Erie

![erie_hab](./reports/figures/erie_hab.png)

The goal of this project is to investigate the relationships between water quality and environmental conditions 
and the presence of algal blooms using water quality data from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. 
This project was performed as the first of two independent capstones for Springboards Data Science Program. The project files
were generated using the cookiecutter data science structure. However, as an initial capstone project you will find many sections
of the file structure have gone unused. Particularly relevant to this project are:

1. the reports directory, where you can find the project proposal and final report documenting findings
2. the notebooks directory, which contains jupyter notebooks for every stage of the project from data wrangling to modeling
3. the data directory, where raw and processed forms of the data are stored.
