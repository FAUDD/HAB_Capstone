It looks like a typo on my part. The first date of collection was 20120515.

Lacey,
After reviewing the submitted data files for accession 0187718, the start date of the data is 
20120515, however the start date entered and used in the title is 20120512. Unless you believe
there is an issue with the data, I will correct the Start Date and the start date used in the 
Title to reflect this correction. Please confirm in your response to this email that you agree 
with that correction or not.
thank you,
Jonathan
