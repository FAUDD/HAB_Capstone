Lacey,
That is not an issue, however I will need you to send the .csv file with the corrected positions 
applied as I am not allowed to edit the data files.
thank you,
Jonathan

Lacey,
When preparing the map for accession 0187718 I discovered what I believe to be a few 
discrepancies in the sample position data.
Row 40 WE8 49.8369 -83.3662
Row 161 WE8 875.7333 -83.3626
Row 267 WE4 41.8268 -88.194
Please review these positions and let me know if they are correct as they are or if I 
need to correct them.
Thank you,
